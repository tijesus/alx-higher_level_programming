Usage:
=========

importing function:
    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [3, 6, 9],
    ...     [12, 15, 18]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1.5, -2.5, 3.5],
    ...     [4.5, 5.5, -6.5]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
    [[0.75, -1.25, 1.75], [2.25, 2.75, -3.25]]

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, -2.2, 3, 4.4, 5],
    ...     [-6.6, 7.00, 8, 9.999, 10]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.33, -0.73, 1.0, 1.47, 1.67], [-2.2, 2.33, 2.67, 3.33, 3.33]]

Checking error for the metrix
    >>> matrix = None
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
 
    >>> matrix = []
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix = "hello"
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix = [[]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[]]


    >>> matrix = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

The same TypeError is raised yet again if any elements in ``matrix`` are
neither ints nor floats.


    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, "hello", 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats


Finally, all the rows in ``matrix`` must be the same size. If any rows are
of different sizes, a new TypeError is raised.

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3, 4],
    ...     [5, 6, 7]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, "not a number"))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, None))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
